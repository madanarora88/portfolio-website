"I build AI products that people actually use at scale, grounded in evals and Responsible AI, and I want to bring that discipline to the hardest problem in collaboration - meetings."
At Walmart, I’ve driven results by building and implementing AI and ML powered internal mobile products tailored for 1.9 million DAU’s across 4600 stores and 220 DC’s with a 80% + adoption rate and avg NPS rating of 85. The app streamlines operations, enhance user experiences, and optimize business efficiency and foster seamless communication. This comprehensive app supports a wide range of functions, including performance tracking, work tools, people management – roster, schedules, learning and development, calendar events and anniversaries, communication, compensable vs on compensable features with CCM

The most prominent GenAI feature in the MyWalmart app is "Ask Sam," a sophisticated conversational AI assistant specifically designed for in-store associates. Ask Sam enables store associates to perform a variety of tasks through simple voice commands or text prompts/queries. Associates can ask questions such as "What aisle is cinnamon located in?" to quickly locate products within the store. Additionally, the assistant can help with looking up prices, providing information about store metrics, and even answering questions about employees' work schedules. This functionality significantly reduces the time associates spend searching for information, allowing them to focus more on customer service and other critical tasks. The system is designed to become more intelligent with use, learning from the questions asked to continuously improve its capabilities.

YOUR JPMC STORY (Show Current State)
When to use: Current work, progression in your career, onboarding/acclimation experience
THE STORY (45 seconds):
"At JPMC, I'm leading AI-driven personalization for onboarding 50,000 annual hires. The challenge is that a software engineer joining in New York has completely different needs than a wealth advisor joining in Dallas.
I'm using segmentation and AI to create tailored onboarding journeys - we cluster users by role, location, and behavior patterns. For engineers, we emphasize tech stack and codebase access. For client-facing roles, we emphasize compliance training and relationship-building tools.
The eval challenge is measuring 'time to productivity' - when is someone actually effective, not just done with onboarding tasks? We're instrumenting this by tracking first meaningful contribution - first code commit for engineers, first client interaction for advisors.

Before JPMC, I spent 3 years at Walmart building GenAI products for 1.2 million frontline workers. My flagship was Ask Sam - a voice-enabled AI assistant across 4,600 stores that reduced query resolution time from 5 minutes to 45 seconds with 97% accuracy.
The interesting arc in my career is going from frontline workers to knowledge workers, understanding that both need AI that's reliable, not experimental. At Walmart, I became obsessive about three things: grounding AI in real data through RAG, building evaluation frameworks that caught problems before users did, and ensuring fairness - I reduced scheduling bias by 73% using SHAP values and counterfactual fairness checks.

Prior Product:  Supply Chain Hiring and Onboarding tool that cut down time to offer from 2 weeks to 24 hours with 4 steps hiring process for HR managers and time to apply for less than 10 mins. This involved digging into data and doing analysis to build AI and ML models with the Data Engineering team for headcount (prompt to hire/hiring helper) and top candidate recommendations for HR
•	Situation: The hiring process at Walmart was inefficient, with time-to-offer taking over two weeks. 2 fold – manager and external candidate pain points
•	Task: Create a tool to streamline hiring and reduce candidate drop-off rates.
•	Action: I built an AI and ML powered tool that recommended top candidates based on workforce data and implemented a two-step hiring process for HR managers.
•	Result: Reduced time-to-offer from 2 weeks to 24 hours, with a 50% reduction in drop-off rates and 90% offer acceptance within 24 hours.
 
  

Question 1: - GEN AI feature – proud/success, deliver result
"Tell me about a time you designed a GenAI-powered feature to solve workflow inefficiencies."
Answer (STAR Framework):

Tell me about a time you failed at work
Situation:
While working on an internal communication tool for retail associates, I led a project to implement a new feature that allowed managers to send real-time task updates and announcements directly to associates’ mobile devices. The goal was to improve task prioritization and reduce the need for in-person check-ins, especially during peak hours.
Task:
My responsibility was to ensure the feature was designed, developed, and launched successfully. The goal was to reduce task completion delays by 20% and improve communication efficiency between managers and associates.
Action:
I worked with engineering and design teams to develop the feature and prioritized speed-to-market over conducting extensive user testing. We assumed that associates would welcome the feature since it streamlined communication. However, we didn’t adequately account for how notifications would impact associates’ workflows or test the feature in stores with varying operational dynamics.
When the feature launched, we immediately received complaints from associates about receiving too many notifications during their shifts, which disrupted their focus on completing tasks. Additionally, some managers used the tool excessively, creating unnecessary noise in the system. This led to frustration among associates and even reduced productivity in some cases.
Result:
The feature failed to achieve its intended goal of improving task prioritization and instead caused confusion and inefficiencies. We had to temporarily disable the feature while we worked on adjustments, delaying the broader rollout by two months.
What I Learned:
This experience taught me several critical lessons:
1.	User-Centered Design Matters: Even internal tools need thorough user testing across diverse environments. What works in one store may not work in another due to differences in workflows or culture.
2.	Balance Is Key: Features designed to improve communication must strike a balance between providing useful updates and avoiding information overload.
3.	Iterative Rollouts Are Essential: A phased rollout with pilot testing in diverse store environments would have allowed us to identify these issues early and address them before scaling.
How I Applied These Lessons:
In a subsequent project involving a workforce scheduling tool, I took a more deliberate approach:
1.	Conducted extensive user research with both managers and associates to understand their pain points and preferences.
2.	Ran pilot tests in stores of varying sizes and operational complexities before scaling the solution.
3.	Built controls into the tool that allowed managers to set limits on notifications, ensuring it wouldn’t disrupt associate workflows.
As a result, the scheduling tool was successfully adopted across all stores, leading to a 25% improvement in scheduling efficiency and a 15% increase in associate satisfaction scores.
This example demonstrates your ability to take ownership of mistakes, learn from them, and apply those lessons to future projects—key qualities for any Product Manager, especially in employee experience roles where user satisfaction is critical

Answer:
Situation
In my previous role as a Product Manager, our team was tasked with launching a new feature aimed at improving user engagement. The deadline was tight due to competitive pressures, but we lacked sufficient user data to validate the design choices. Waiting for comprehensive data would have delayed the launch and risked losing market share.
Task
I needed to make a decision on whether to proceed with the feature rollout based on limited insights or delay the launch to gather more data. The challenge was balancing speed with product quality while mitigating risks.
Action
I applied a Bias for Action approach by leveraging the following steps:
1.	Data-informed decision-making: I reviewed existing user feedback and analytics from similar features to identify patterns and assumptions.
2.	Stakeholder alignment: I consulted cross-functional teams (engineering, design, and customer support) to gather their input and ensure alignment.
3.	Risk mitigation: Instead of a full-scale launch, I proposed releasing the feature as an A/B test to a small segment of users. This allowed us to gather real-world feedback quickly while minimizing potential negative impacts.

Can you share an instance where you had to balance multiple stakeholders with competing priorities
Balancing Multiple Stakeholders with Competing Priorities (conflict)
I use a weighted scoring framework that balances three factors:
1.	Customer impact (e.g., NPS lift, feature requests)
2.	Business value (revenue potential, strategic alignment)
3.	Effort (engineering complexity, time-to-market)

For example, during a recent onboarding project, legal stakeholders wanted to prioritize compliance updates, while marketing pushed for a referral program. By scoring both against our KPIs (risk reduction vs. acquisition growth), we compromised by sequencing compliance updates first but allocating 20% of sprint capacity to referral prototypes.

YOUR THREE HERO STORIES (KNOW THESE COLD)
STORY 1: ASK SAM - Your GenAI Flagship
When to use: GenAI experience, agentic AI, RAG implementation, scaling AI
THE STORY (90 seconds):
Situation: "At Walmart, store associates spent 15-20% of their shift manually searching for product locations, prices, and policy details. This impacted customer service response times and employee satisfaction."
Task: "My goal was to reduce time spent on repetitive queries by 50% while maintaining 95%+ accuracy in responses."
Action: "I led a cross-functional team to develop Ask Sam, a voice-enabled GenAI assistant. The biggest challenge was hallucinations - early on, the AI would confidently give wrong information like incorrect aisle numbers or outdated prices, and trust collapsed immediately.
I implemented three critical fixes:
First, Retrieval-Augmented Generation - we grounded every response in real-time inventory data and verified policy documents. No generation without retrieval.
Second, I built a feedback loop where associates could flag incorrect responses directly in the app, which fed back into our eval system. This became our primary signal for model improvement.
Third, I worked with our applied science team to establish accuracy thresholds - we wouldn't ship to new stores unless we hit 95%+ accuracy on our test sets. I also added transparency - the AI showed its source, like 'Based on store inventory data from 10 minutes ago.'"
Result:
•	Reduced average query resolution time from 5 minutes to 45 seconds
•	Achieved 97% accuracy within 6 months post-launch
•	Scaled to 4,600+ stores with 82% weekly active usage among associates
•	This was truly agentic AI - it understood context, took action, and got better over time
STORY 2: SCHEDULING BIAS - Your Responsible AI Flagship
When to use: Responsible AI, fairness, being a DRI, handling bias
THE STORY (60 seconds):
Situation: "While building an ML-powered scheduling feature at Walmart, we discovered the algorithm was biasing toward full-time workers over part-time workers for premium shifts - evening and weekend shifts that paid more."
Task: "As the DRI for fixing this, my responsibility was to redesign the algorithm to ensure equitable shift distribution while maintaining operational efficiency."
Action: "I took three approaches:
First, I conducted fairness audits using SHAP values to identify bias drivers in historical scheduling data. Turns out, the model learned from past patterns where full-timers had been over-scheduled by human managers.
Second, I collaborated with Walmart's Responsible AI team to implement counterfactual fairness checks - if we changed someone's employment status from part-time to full-time, would their shift recommendations change inappropriately? If yes, we had bias.
Third, and most important, I added transparency features showing associates the 'why' behind shift recommendations: 'You're prioritized for this closing shift due to your availability and forklift certification' - not just a black box.
I also established continuous monitoring with demographic parity metrics that ran in production, not just during testing. Bias creeps in over time as patterns change."
Result:
•	Reduced scheduling bias by 73% while maintaining 98% shift acceptance rates
•	Won internal innovation award for ethical AI implementation
•	Built ongoing instrumentation that caught bias drift before it impacted users

STORY 3: HIRING TOOL - Your Eval-First Story
When to use: AI evals, measuring AI product success, iterative development
THE STORY (60 seconds):
Situation: "The hiring process at Walmart was inefficient - time-to-offer took over 2 weeks. We had two-fold pain: managers couldn't fill positions fast enough, and external candidates were dropping off during the long wait."
Task: "Create an AI-powered tool to streamline hiring and reduce candidate drop-off rates."
Action: "I built an AI/ML-powered tool that recommended top candidates based on workforce data and implemented a streamlined hiring process. But the key was the eval framework - I knew AI recommendations are only valuable if managers trust them.
I set up three evaluation layers:
Layer 1 - Model performance: Precision and recall on historical hires - were we recommending people who would have been hired anyway? We needed 90%+ precision to earn manager trust.
Layer 2 - User behavior: Did managers actually interview our recommendations? Did they override the AI? Override rate above 30% meant the AI wasn't useful, even if model metrics looked good.
Layer 3 - Business outcomes: Time-to-offer, candidate drop-off rate, offer acceptance rate. The AI was only successful if it moved business metrics.
We ran all three in parallel. Good model metrics with bad user behavior meant we had a UX problem, not a model problem. We iterated weekly based on these signals."
Result:
•	Reduced time-to-offer from 2 weeks to 24 hours
•	50% reduction in candidate drop-off rates
•	90% offer acceptance within 24 hours
•	Manager trust in AI recommendations went from 45% to 87% over 6 months
